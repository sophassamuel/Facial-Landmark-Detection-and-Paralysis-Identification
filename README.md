# BreadcrumbsFacial-Landmark-Detection-and-Paralysis-Identification

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and MobileNet for facial landmark detection and paralysis identification. It is built using Python 3.11 and Flask as the web framework for serving the model. The application can detect facial landmarks and analyze the symmetry of the face to identify potential signs of facial paralysis.

## Introduction

Facial landmark detection is a crucial step in various computer vision applications, including facial recognition, emotion detection, and medical diagnosis. This project focuses on detecting facial landmarks and identifying potential facial paralysis using a CNN-based MobileNet model.

## Features

- **Facial Landmark Detection:** Detects key facial landmarks like eyes, nose, mouth, etc.
- **Paralysis Identification:** Analyzes the symmetry of the detected landmarks to identify signs of facial paralysis.
- **Web Interface:** A simple and interactive web interface using Flask for real-time detection.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- pip (Python package installer)
